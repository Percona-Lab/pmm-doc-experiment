# Configuring PMM Client with pmm-admin config

## Connecting PMM Clients to the PMM Server

With your server and clients set up, you must configure each {{ pmm_client }} and
specify which {{ pmm_server }} it should send its data to.

To connect a {{ pmm_client }}, enter the IP address of the {{ pmm_server }} as the value
of the `--server-url` parameter to the {{ pmm_admin_config }} command, and
allow using self-signed certificates with `--server-insecure-tls`.

!!! note 
    The `--server-url` argument should include `https://` prefix
and PMM Server credentials, which are **admin/admin** by default, if
not changed at first PMM Server GUI access.

{{ tip_run_this_root }}

```bash
$ pmm-admin config --server-insecure-tls --server-url=https://admin:admin@192.168.100.1:443
```

For example, if your {{ pmm_server }} is running on 192.168.100.1, you have
installed {{ pmm_client }} on a machine with IP 192.168.200.1, and didnâ€™t change
default PMM Server credentials, run the following in the terminal of your
client. {{ tip_run_all_root }}:

```bash
# pmm-admin config --server-insecure-tls --server-url=https://admin:admin@192.168.100.1:443
Checking local pmm-agent status...
pmm-agent is running.
Registering pmm-agent on PMM Server...
Registered.
Configuration file /usr/local/percona/pmm-agent.yaml updated.
Reloading pmm-agent configuration...
Configuration reloaded.
Checking local pmm-agent status...
pmm-agent is running.
```

If you change the default port **443** when running PMM Server, specify the new port number after the IP
address of {{ pmm_server }}.

!!! note
    By default `pmm-admin config` refuses to add client if it already exists in the PMM Server inventory database. If you need to re-add an already existing client (e.g. after full reinstall, hostname changes, etc.), you can run `pmm-admin config` with the additional `--force` option. This will remove an existing node with the same name, if any, and all its dependent services.
